Adding Tasks:

When the user enters a task in the EditText and taps the "Add Task" button, you need to capture the task text.
Use a database helper class (TaskDbHelper in the provided example) to insert the task into the database.
After adding the task, refresh the list to display the updated task list.
Displaying Tasks:

Retrieve the list of tasks from the database using the database helper class (TaskDbHelper).
Populate a ListView or RecyclerView with the list of tasks.
Use an adapter (ArrayAdapter in the provided example) to bind the task data to the list view.
Editing Tasks (Optional):

To allow users to edit tasks, you can implement a long click listener on the ListView items.
When a task item is long-clicked, open a dialog or a new activity where the user can edit the task text.
After editing, update the task in the database and refresh the list to reflect the changes.
Deleting Tasks:

Implement a click listener on the task items in the ListView.
When a task item is clicked, prompt the user for confirmation (optional) and delete the task from the database.
Refresh the list to remove the deleted task from the display.
Persisting Data:

Use a SQLite database to persist the tasks locally on the device.
Implement database helper methods (TaskDbHelper in the provided example) to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tasks.
Ensure proper error handling and data validation to maintain data integrity.
User Interface:

Design a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily interact with the app.
Use appropriate UI components such as EditText for entering tasks, ListView or RecyclerView for displaying tasks, and buttons for actions like adding or deleting tasks.
Consider implementing features such as swipe-to-delete or drag-and-drop for enhanced user experience (optional).
Testing and Refinement:

Test your app thoroughly on different devices and screen sizes to ensure compatibility and responsiveness.
Solicit feedback from users and iterate on your app to improve features and usability.
Address any bugs or issues reported by users through updates and patches.
